## Data frame exploration

### Setting up

First, check the existing packages in your computer. 
`data(package = .packages(all.available = TRUE))`

If you don't have the package you need, visit [Contributed Packages](https://cran.r-project.org), run `install.packages(yourpackage_name)` in the console before next move.

### Choose package and data set

Data set 'animals' in package ‘cluster’

```{r}
library(cluster)
```

```{r}
print(animals)
```


### Exploration of data frames

Explore `animals` with functions like `name`, `head`, `tail`, `str`, `summary`.

```{r}
#list the variables in animals
names(animals)
#print first 5 rows in animals
head(animals,n=5L)
#print last 2 rows in animals
tail(animals,n=2L)
#list the structure of animals
str(animals)
#result summaries
summary(animals)
```
